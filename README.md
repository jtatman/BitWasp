Specifically, this version will be updated to interface with Monero, not bitcoin as an exercise.

BitWasp is an open source PHP project which allows anyone to set up a secure bitcoin marketplace independent of other centralized services.

It features multi-signature transactions, meaning no live wallet to steal. Users can also recover their funds from the site if it goes offline.

BitWasp is not production ready
